# Data-Linkage-Classification-Project
**note**: All code are in Python 3 and by me, completed for COMP20008 - Elements of Data Processing Project 2 in 2020 Semester 1 at The University of Melbourne.

## Overview
For this project, you will perform a data linkage on two real-world datasets (Part 1) and explore different classification algorithms (Part 2).
### Part One: Data Linkage
Amazon and Google both have product databases. They would like to link the same products in order to perform joint market research.

1. Naive Data Linkage
2. Blocking Method
3. Written Report: Analysis of Data Linkage Methods and Procedures

### Part Two: Classification
Each year, the World Bank publishes the World Development Indicators which provide high quality and international comparable statistics about global development and the fight against poverty [1]. As data scientists, we wish to understand how the information can be used to predict average lifespan in different countries. To this end, we have provided the world.csv file, which contains some of the World Development Indicators for each country and the life.csv file containing information about the average lifespan for each country (based on data from the World Health Organization) [2]. Each data file also contains a country name, country code and year as identifiers for each record. These may be used to link the two datasets but should not be considered features.

1. Comparing Classification Algorithms: k-NN vs. Decision Tree
2. Feature Engineering and Selection: Interaction Term Pairs, Clustering Labels, Principal Component Analysis
3. Written Report: Analysis of Classification Implementations
